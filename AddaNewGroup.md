# Add a New Group

This adds one or more groups for the account.

Groups can be used to help manage users by associating users with a group.
A group can be associated with a Permission Profile, which sets the user permissions
for users in that group without having to set the userSettings for each user. You are not
required to set Permission Profiles for a group, but this makes it easier to manage user permissions
for a large number of users. Groups can also be used with template sharing to limit user access to templates.
